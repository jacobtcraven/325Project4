# scraping.py

"""
This module is responsible for fetching HTML content from a given URL and optionally saving it as raw HTML.
It demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by focusing solely on web scraping functionalities.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is applied
This makes the system more maintainable and adaptable to change.

Functions:
    fetch_html(url, save_raw=True): Fetches the HTML content from the specified URL. It can also save the raw HTML to a file.
    save_raw_html(html_content, url): Saves the raw HTML content to a specified file within the Data/raw directory.

The SRP enhances maintainability and scalability by isolating the web scraping logic, making the module easy to update or replace if necessary.
